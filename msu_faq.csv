Cybersecurity,How does the institution align cybersecurity requirements for sensitive sponsored projects?,"ORC and DiT work jointly to align protocols with NIST SP 800-171 and CMMC expectations; DiT provides secure storage environments for regulated data (e.g., CUI/FCI/export-controlled/proprietary). Reference: SOP §7."
Cybersecurity,When is a Technology Control Plan (TCP) required and who drafts it?,"A TCP is required when a sponsored project involves sensitive data and/or export-controlled information; the faculty researcher drafts it and submits it to ORC for review, using the TCP checklist/template. Reference: SOP §7.2."
Cybersecurity,Who must approve a TCP before it is implemented?,"TCPs must be reviewed/approved by the researcher(s), department chair/director, dean, an ORC designee, and applicable physical security and information security designees before implementation. Reference: SOP §7.2."
Cybersecurity,Where are TCP-related documents stored and who can access them?,"Documents related to TCPs are stored securely with role-based access (e.g., ORC shared drive); ORC sets periodic review/monitoring processes. Reference: SOP §7.3."
Cybersecurity,What is required for Department of Defense awards under CMMC?,"DoD contractors must certify CMMC compliance at award and annually; the Affirming Official (AO) is the senior-level representative authorized to affirm cybersecurity posture, with ORC consulting DiT on requirements. Reference: SOP §7.4 and §3 (AO; CMMC)."
Training,What annual training is required for cybersecurity and research security?,MSU annual cybersecurity awareness training is required for system access; ORC provides access to CITI Program training and encourages completion of Research Security modules. Reference: SOP §7.5.
FCOI,What is a Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI) in sponsored programs?,"An FCOI exists when a researcher’s personal financial interests could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, or reporting of sponsored research; it signals a need for transparency and oversight. Reference: SOP §8."
FCOI,How often are FCOI disclosures required and when must they be updated?,"Annual disclosures are required for all faculty researchers/key personnel, regardless of whether an interest exists; disclosures must be updated when new/changed financial interests arise. Reference: SOP §8.1."
FCOI,How often must FCOI training be renewed?,FCOI training is required before participating in sponsored research and must be renewed at least every four years (or more often if required by sponsors/policy or due to noncompliance). Reference: SOP §8.1.
FCOI,What happens if a faculty member fails to complete required FCOI disclosure or training?,"ORC monitors compliance and may restrict proposal submission, award acceptance, or research activity for individuals who fail to meet requirements. Reference: SOP §8.1."
FCOI,How can a researcher appeal a conflict-of-interest determination?,Appeals are initiated through written notification to the Vice President for Research and Economic Development; further escalation may proceed according to institutional governance. Reference: SOP §8.3.
Export Controls,What kinds of activities trigger an export control review?,International collaborations/foreign travel; participation of foreign nationals; shipping/hand-carrying/electronic transfer of materials/software/technical data outside the U.S.; traveling with devices containing sensitive info; contractual publication/access restrictions; and activities conducted outside the U.S. Reference: SOP §9.1.
